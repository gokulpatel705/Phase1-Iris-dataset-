IRIS Dataset




*shape= (150,5) 
*Information about Feature
   1 All columns are not having any Null Entries

   2 Four columns are numerical type

   3 Only Single column categorical type
          a) setosa
          b) virginica
          c) versicolor 

*Statistical Analysis using describe()  
     Mean values
     Standard Deviation ,
     Minimum Values
     Maximum Values 

*one Duplicate value present but we want to balanced dataset and our data is well balanced. each species has 50 count.

Correlation:
          Sepal Length and Sepal Width features are slightly correlated with each other
     

distribution:
      sepal_length - purely Normal distribution
       sepal_width - nearly Normal distribution

Scatter plot:
   1) sepal_length vs sepal_width :
                a) Iris Setosa species has smaller sepal length but higher width.
                b) Versicolor lies in almost middle for length as well as width
                c) Virginica has larger sepal lengths and smaller sepal widths
   2) petal_length vs petal_width:
                a) Setosa species have the smallest petal length as well as petal width
                b) Versicolor species have average petal length and petal width
                c) Virginica species have the highest petal length as well as petal width 
Pair plot :
    1) High co relation between petal length and width columns. 
    2) Setosa has both low petal length and width
    3) Versicolor has both average petal length and width
    4) Virginica has both high petal length and width.
    5) Sepal width for setosa is high and length is low.
    6) Versicolor have average values for for sepal dimensions.
    7) Virginica has small width but large sepal length
